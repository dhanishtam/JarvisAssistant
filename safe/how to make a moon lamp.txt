Here is a simple method to make a moon lamp using a balloon and paper mache:

Materials:

* Black or dark gray paint
* White paint or white paint pen
* PVA glue
* Water
* Newspaper
* Balloon
* String or twine
* A small light bulb or LED light
* A lamp kit (optional)

Instructions:

1. Inflate the balloon to the size you want your moon lamp to be.
2. Mix equal parts of PVA glue and water to create a paper mache paste.
3. Tear newspaper into long strips.
4. Dip each strip of newspaper into the paste, making sure it is fully coated.
5. Place the wet strip onto the balloon, smoothing it out as you go.
6. Repeat steps 4-5, covering the balloon completely and allowing the layers to dry. You may need to apply 3-4 layers of paper mache for a sturdy surface.
7. Once the paper mache is dry, pop the balloon and remove it from the inside.
8. Paint the entire surface of the paper mache ball with black or dark gray paint, creating a realistic moon surface.
9. Once the paint is dry, use a white paint pen or white paint to add details such as craters and shadows.
10. Attach a string or twine to the top of the lamp, creating a handle.
11. Insert a small light bulb or LED light into the lamp, or use a lamp kit for a more secure fit.
12. Hang or place the moon lamp in a dark room to enjoy its soft, ambient glow.

Note: This project requires patience and time for the paper mache and paint to dry. Make sure to allow enough time for each step before moving on to the next.
