In the realm of dreams, where thoughts take flight,
A bed of rest, a sanctuary of light.

A place of peace, where worries cease,
A haven of calm in life's tumultuous seas.

A source of strength, a wellspring of power,
A boost for the soul, each restful hour.

So climb between the sheets, let go of the day,
In slumber's embrace, find your own gentle way.

For in the morning, you will rise anew,
With motivation, and a mind that's clear and true.

Embrace the bed, its gifts to bestow,
A path to success, a steady glow.
