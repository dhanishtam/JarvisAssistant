Subject: Notification of Absence from Work Today

Dear [Boss's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to come to work today. I woke up feeling unwell and have decided to take the day off to rest and recover. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work when I return.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Dhanishta
