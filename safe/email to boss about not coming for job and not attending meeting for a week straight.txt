Subject: Notification of Absence and Meeting Non-Attendance for the Past Week

Dear [Boss's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I have been unable to attend work or meetings for the past week. Due to unforeseen personal circumstances, I have been unable to fulfill my professional responsibilities.

I understand the inconvenience this may have caused and I apologize for any disruption to the workflow. I will make sure to catch up on any missed work and meetings upon my return.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Best regards,
Dhanishta
